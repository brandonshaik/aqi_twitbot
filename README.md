# Air Quality Twitter Bot
This is a bot created with Node.JS which uses the AirVisual API to tweet the live air quality index (AQI) value for Boston, MA. every hour and categorizes the score (good, moderate, unhealthy, etc.). The idea for this bot came after reading an article that claimed [breathing the air in boston is like smoking five cigarettes a year](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiomI2av5HXAhUC7IMKHYm1AE8QFggmMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.boston.com%2Fnews%2Flocal-news%2F2015%2F08%2F28%2Fbreathing-boston-air-is-like-smoking-5-cigarettes-a-year&usg=AOvVaw0JRzSgnrVBCYPszwHZmtpe). This is an effort to catalog the air quality in real time.
