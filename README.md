# Air Quality Twitter Bot
This is a bot created with Node.JS which uses the AirVisual API to tweet the live air quality index (AQI) score for Boston, MA. The bot is scheduled to call the API every hour and if the AQI score has changed it tweets the score and categorizes the it (good, moderate, unhealthy, etc). The idea for this bot came after reading an article that claimed [breathing the air in boston is like smoking five cigarettes a year](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiomI2av5HXAhUC7IMKHYm1AE8QFggmMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.boston.com%2Fnews%2Flocal-news%2F2015%2F08%2F28%2Fbreathing-boston-air-is-like-smoking-5-cigarettes-a-year&usg=AOvVaw0JRzSgnrVBCYPszwHZmtpe). This is an effort to catalog the air quality in real time.
